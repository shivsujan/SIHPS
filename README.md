## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea

User Input:
Users input their location either by entering their address or allowing the website to access their current location through geolocation services.

Search Algorithm:
The website uses a search algorithm to find e-waste collection facilities within a specified radius of the user's location. The algorithm takes into account factors such as distance, operating hours, accepted items, and facility ratings.

Map Integration:
The search results are displayed on an interactive map, with each facility represented by a marker. Users can click on the markers to view more information about each facility, such as address, contact details, accepted items, and user reviews.

Filtering Options:
Users can filter the search results based on criteria such as accepted items (e.g., computers, mobile phones, batteries), facility type (e.g., drop-off center, recycling center), and operating hours. This helps users find facilities that meet their specific needs.

Directions:
Users can get directions to the selected facility from their current location using integrated mapping services like Google Maps or Apple Maps. This makes it easy for users to plan their visit to the facility.

Additional Information:
The E-Waste Facility Locator may also provide additional information about e-waste recycling, such as tips for preparing electronics for recycling, information about the recycling process, and links to relevant resources and organizations.

User Feedback:
Users can provide feedback and reviews of e-waste collection facilities to help improve the accuracy and usefulness of the locator. This feedback may include ratings, comments, and suggestions for improvement.

## Technology Stack

HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the website. JavaScript: For client-side interactivity and functionality. React.js or Angular.js: Popular frontend frameworks for building dynamic user interfaces. Mapping Library (e.g., Google Maps API): For displaying the locations of e-waste facilities on a map. 2.Backend Development: Server-side Language (e.g., Node.js, Python): For handling server-side logic. Express.js (for Node.js) or Flask/Django (for Python): Lightweight web frameworks for building server-side applications. Database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL): For storing information about e-waste facilities and user data. Geocoding API (e.g., Google Geocoding API): To convert addresses into geographic coordinates for mapping purposes. 3.APIs and External Services: E-Waste Facility Data API: If available, you may integrate with an existing API that provides data on e-waste facilities. Geolocation API: For retrieving the user's location to provide personalized results. 4.Deployment and Hosting: Cloud Platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Platform): For hosting the application and database. Domain Registrar: For registering a domain name for your website. SSL Certificate: To ensure secure communication between the server and the client. 5.Additional Tools and Libraries: Version Control System (e.g., Git): For managing codebase changes and collaboration. Package Managers (e.g., npm, yarn): For managing dependencies. UI Frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Material-UI): Optional for faster UI development. 6.Security: Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data and functionalities. Data Encryption: Ensure that sensitive data such as user credentials are encrypted during transmission and storage. Input Validation: Validate user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). 7.Testing: Unit Testing Frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha): For testing individual components and functions. Integration Testing: Test the interaction between different components of your application. UI Testing Tools (e.g., Selenium, Cypress): For automated testing of the user interface.
